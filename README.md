## opencv_solver
Android app that takes a picture of a Sudoku puzzle and finds a solution. Senior Project in Comuputer Science at CSU, Chico.

The current plan is to make a basic android app that can take and send send a picture to a server for image processing. Then the server sends back the solution to display.
